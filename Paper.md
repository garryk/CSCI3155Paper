Birth of withFilter
========================

Motivation: Why do people want this?

Rejected ideas: What were some other solutions?

Accepted idea: Why was withFilter accepted when other things weren't?

Implementation: Maybe go into the implementation, uses flat map so this is relevent. Also, maybe check to see if it has been changed in more recent revisions
